# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Setup pnpm
      - name: Setup Node.js environment
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '16'
          cache: 'pnpm'

      - name: Install pnpm
        run: npm install -g pnpm

      # Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pnpm install

      # Build the project

      # You can add additional steps here, such as deployment steps, if needed
